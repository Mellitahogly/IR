SloppyLemming APT
SloppyLemming, also tracked by CrowdStrike as OUTRIDER TIGER, is known for using cloud service providers to collect credentials, deliver malware, and command and control (C2) activities. The group often uses open frameworks to emulate the enemy, such as Cobalt Strike and Havoc.

Cloudforce One notes that the group's operations exhibit a low level of operational security, allowing Cloudforce One to gain insight into their tools and tactics. A key focus of their business is to collect credentials, which is often achieved through phishing emails that lead victims to fake login pages hosted on malicious Cloudflare Workers. The group uses a tool called CloudPhish to scan the HTML content of login pages and log stolen credentials via Discord.

In addition to phishing, SloppyLemming has been seen collecting Google OAuth tokens and using malware. For example, they used Dropbox to host malicious RAR files that exploit WinRAR vulnerabilities, specifically CVE-2023-38831. These files contain executable files that deploy remote access tools (RATs), allowing the group to maintain long-term access to the breached systems.

SloppyLemming's credential collection operations mainly target organizations in Pakistan, mainly in sectors such as government, transportation, education, technology, and energy. Notably, the group has a particular interest in Pakistani law enforcement agencies and organizations related to the country's nuclear power. Outside Pakistan, SloppyLemming's activities extend to government and military organizations in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, as well as to the Chinese energy and scientific communities.
